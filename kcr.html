<h2>POLITICIAN KCR CAREER PATH</h2>
<Pre style="background-color: lightpink;">
Rao was sworn in as the first chief minister of the Telangana state on 2 June 2014.
Rao, a staunch believer in astrology, numerology and vaastu, is reported to have fixed 12:57 PM
for his inauguration as per the advice of priests to suit his lucky number 'six', since the sum 
of the digits at that time is six.[26] He was re-elected eight times as TRS president.[29] In September
2018, he dissolved the Telangana Legislative Assembly, nine months before its term ends to go for an 
early election, in a move that has been called a masterstroke.
