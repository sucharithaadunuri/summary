<h2>VIRAT KOHLI CAREER PATH</h2>
<Pre style="background-color: lightpink;">
Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently 
drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who he regarded
as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's
"successor",[19][20] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass 
his records in the future.[21][22] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model,
who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented.
Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating 
his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[</Pre>
