<h2>SINGER KARTHIK CAREER PATH</h2>
<Pre style="background-color: lightpink;">
    Karthik had a good interest in music early in his life and had learnt Carnatic music during his school days. 
    Later on he started singing for his college band and regularly participated in IIT Madras Fest ‘Sarang’. 
    After nearly a year since his meeting with Srinivas,
    Karthik received a call one night from him. Apparently, Rahman needed a fresh voice for backing vocalists
    for a song from Pukar and Srinivas could not get in touch with one of the singers and 
    then he remembered Karthik and tried to get in touch with one of the singers and then he remembered Karthik and 
    tried to get in touch with him.
