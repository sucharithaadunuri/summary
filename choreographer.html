<h2>PRABHU DEVA CAREER PATH</h2>
<Pre style="background-color: lightpink;">
    After a series of cameo appearances in songs from Tamil films,
    Deva was given his first lead role by director Pavithran in the romantic drama film Indhu (1994).
    Appearing alongside actress Roja and Sarathkumar, Deva's ability to dance was fully utilised in the
    song sequences, with gaana and disco music thereafter being regularly featured in his films.
    He made his breakthrough as an actor with Shankar's sophomore film, the romantic drama Kadhalan (1994), 
    where he portrayed a young student who first stands up against his lover's father and then an international 
    terrorist.
